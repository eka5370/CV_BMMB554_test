## EDUCATION
**PHD BMMB PROGRAM • AUG 2025 – CURRENT • PENN STATE UNIVERSITY**

•	Performing research within the Bisanz lab pertaining to PFAS and the gut microbiome

**BS BIOLOGY AND BS CHEMISTRY• AUG 2021 -- MAY 2025 • EMORY UNIVERSITY**

•	Chemistry degree was obtained with a biomolecular specialization

## WORK EXPERIENCE
**UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCHER• EMORY UNIVERSITY • JAN 2024 – MAY 2025**

Worked in Dr. Yonggang Ke’s lab at Emory University where I gained exposure to DNA/RNA nanostructure design. Conducted research on determining the one-carbon metabolism pathway of SHH-driven medulloblastomas via quantification of DNA oligonucleotides. Additionally, observed and discussed lab techniques such as TEM. 

**ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEER INTERN• LANGAN• JUN 2024 -- AUG 2024**

Visited various NY and NJ sites for soil sampling, groundwater sampling, and construction oversight focused on environmental remediation. Worked on data validation of lab samples to determine exceedances in certain contaminations of interest. 

**UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCHER • THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY • MAY 2023 -- JUL 2023**

Participated in a nine-week summer research program with The Ohio State University, working with Dr. Patrick Woodward and the Woodward lab on the magnetism of specific complex oxides at variable temperatures. Gained hands-on experience with XRD and SQUID measurements and presented my findings in a research symposium

**CHEMISTRY TEACHING ASSISTANT• EMORY UNIVERSITY • JAN 2022 -- DEC 2022**

Prepared lab materials and substances as a lab preparatory assistant. Also worked as a lab teaching assistant to help students better understand basic lab concepts such as acid/base reactions and nucleophilic substitution as well as proper lab techniques.

## PROJECTS/PRESENTATIONS
•	Co-author of “PFAS drive gut dysbiosis and antibiotic resistance” manuscript

•	Made and presented a poster of my research toward SHH medulloblastoma one-carbon metabolism at Emory’s Spring research symposium

•	Made and presented a slide deck on OSU research on research on magnetism of hexagonal perovskites at summer research symposium

## SKILLS
