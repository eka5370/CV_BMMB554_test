## Introduction

I recently created this website to showcase my CV and share my thoughts through blog posts. I chose [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) as the framework because it's powerful, flexible, and integrates seamlessly with GitHub Pages for automatic deployment.

## Why Quarto?

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that makes it easy to create beautiful websites, blogs, and documents. Here are some reasons I chose it:

- **Easy to use**: Write content in Markdown
- **Built-in blog support**: Listing pages and post management out of the box
- **Customizable**: Lots of themes and styling options
- **GitHub Actions integration**: Deploy automatically to GitHub Pages
- **Academic-friendly**: Great for researchers and scientists who want to share their work

## The Setup Process

### 1. Installing Quarto

First, I installed Quarto on my system. On Linux, this was straightforward:

```bash
wget https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/releases/download/v1.4.553/quarto-1.4.553-linux-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i quarto-1.4.553-linux-amd64.deb
```

### 2. Project Structure

I organized the project with the following structure:

```
├── _quarto.yml          # Main configuration file
├── index.md             # CV/Homepage
├── blog/
│   ├── index.qmd        # Blog listing page
│   └── posts/           # Individual blog posts
│       └── 2026-02-17-creating-this-website/
│           └── index.qmd
├── styles.css           # Custom styling
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        └── publish.yml  # GitHub Actions deployment
```

### 3. Configuration

The `_quarto.yml` file is the heart of the website configuration. It defines:

- The website structure and navigation
- Links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles
- Theme and styling preferences
- Blog listing configuration

### 4. GitHub Actions Deployment

One of the best features is automatic deployment. Every time I push changes to the main branch, GitHub Actions:

1. Checks out the repository
2. Sets up Quarto
3. Renders the website
4. Deploys it to GitHub Pages

This means I can focus on writing content, and the website updates automatically!

## Writing Blog Posts

Each blog post is a Quarto document (`.qmd` file) with YAML frontmatter that includes:

- Title and author
- Publication date
- Categories for organization
- A description for previews

The blog automatically generates a listing page with all posts sorted by date.

## Next Steps

Now that the website is set up, I plan to:

- Share research updates and findings
- Write tutorials on techniques I'm learning
- Document my PhD journey in the BMMB program

## Conclusion

Building this website with Quarto was surprisingly straightforward, and the result is a professional-looking site that's easy to maintain. If you're a researcher or scientist looking to establish an online presence, I highly recommend giving Quarto a try!
